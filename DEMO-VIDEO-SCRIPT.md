## Key Talking Points: Bidirectional System

**Why It's Important for Hackathon:**
This demonstrates advanced multi-agent collaboration where agents don't just work independently—they trigger each other's execution based on context and state.

**Highlight These Features:**

1. **Task → Meeting Triggers**
   - "After completing 2-4 tasks, the system automatically schedules a project review meeting"
   - "If you fail a task twice, a feedback session is triggered to help you improve"
   - "The system monitors your dashboard and generates meetings when needed"

2. **Meeting → Task Triggers**
   - "Meetings generate 0-3 follow-up tasks based on the discussions"
   - "Action items from meetings become actual work assignments"
   - "The system ensures you always have 3-5 tasks to work on"

3. **Intelligent Monitoring**
   - "The Workflow Orchestrator continuously monitors dashboard state"
   - "Target: 3-5 tasks and 1-2 meetings at all times"
   - "Content generation adapts to your performance and level"

4. **Context Propagation**
   - "Tasks reference the meetings they came from"
   - "Meetings discuss the tasks you recently completed"
   - "Creates a continuous narrative through your career"

**Demo Flow to Show Bidirectional System:**
1. Complete 2-3 tasks quickly
2. Show meeting notification appearing
3. Join meeting and participate
4. Show meeting completion generating new tasks
5. Point out how tasks reference the meeting
6. Complete another task to show continuous loop
