## Option 1: Technical Focus (for developer audience)

🚀 Just shipped CareerRoguelike for the Google Cloud Run Hackathon!

I built a multi-agent AI job market simulator that demonstrates what's possible when you combine:
• 7 specialized AI agents (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
• Centralized orchestration pattern
• 100% serverless on Cloud Run
• Real-time state management with Firestore

The architecture:
→ Job Agent generates realistic listings
→ Interview Agent creates tailored questions
→ Grader Agent evaluates with strict criteria
→ Task Agent produces varied work assignments
→ CV Agent updates your resume automatically
→ Meeting Agents simulate workplace interactions

Key learnings:
✅ Orchestration > Autonomy for production AI
✅ Cloud Run scales perfectly for AI workloads
✅ Pre-validation saves 30% on API costs
✅ Direct Gemini API calls beat abstraction layers

Built with: Google Cloud Run, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Firestore, Python FastAPI, React + TypeScript

## Option 3: Story Focus (for engagement)

💡 Two weeks ago, I asked myself: "Can AI simulate a realistic career journey?"

Today, I have the answer: CareerRoguelike 🚀

The challenge: Build a job market simulator where EVERYTHING is AI-generated:
• Job listings
• Interview questions
• Work tasks
• Meeting scenarios
• Career feedback

The solution: 7 specialized AI agents working together:

1️⃣ Job Agent → Creates 10 profession-specific listings
2️⃣ Interview Agent → Generates tailored questions
3️⃣ Grader Agent → Evaluates with strict criteria
4️⃣ Task Agent → Produces varied assignments
5️⃣ CV Agent → Updates your resume
6️⃣ Meeting Agents → Simulate workplace interactions

The tech: Google Cloud Run + Gemini 2.5 Flash + Firestore

The result: A production-ready AI application that:
✅ Scales to zero (cost = $0 when idle)
✅ Responds in <3 seconds
✅ Handles 100+ concurrent users
✅ Generates unique content every time
