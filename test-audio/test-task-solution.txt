This is my solution for the task: Implement Basic UI Test.
    I will implement this feature by following these steps:
    First, I'll analyze the requirements and create a detailed plan.
    Then, I'll implement the core functionality with proper error handling.
    I'll write comprehensive tests to ensure quality.
    Finally, I'll document the implementation and submit for review.
    This approach ensures a robust and maintainable solution.
